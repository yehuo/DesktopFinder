Sometime, you can find some of Windowsâ€˜s screensaver are so amazing for most of them are photoed by professional photographers from all over the world.

And some of them could be photoed in your hometown, which make them more meaningful to you.

When I try to get these pictures as wallpapers of some other divices, I found it so difficult to download these pictures without watermark from web. So I want to get these good-looking from local dir.

However, most of pictures are just saved temporarily in Windows.They could be replaced by new ones any time.

This application are just coded for this.

Through this application, you could save these good-looking pictures permanently in your computer and browse them in a compact interface.
